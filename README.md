## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Andrew I am a passionate and driven data scientist with 1 year of experience in leveraging data to generate insights and drive decision-making. Fluent in English and Spanish, with intermediate proficiency in French, I thrive in multicultural and collaborative environments.

My technical expertise includes Python, Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, SQL, and foundational knowledge of machine learning. I am equally skilled in crafting compelling data visualizations and manging predictive models to solve real-world problems.

What sets me apart is my strong set of soft skillsâ€”adaptability, teamwork, and communicationâ€”enabling me to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders effectively.

I am eager to continue growing as a data scientist and contributing to impactful projects. Let's connect! ðŸš€
